From here, you can drill-down to different sections of cBioPortal.  For beginners, the two most important tabs are "Tutorials" and "FAQ".

With that, you are ready to try your first query.  For this section, we will explore the [Cholangiocarcinoma study from MSKCC](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=chol_msk_2018).  If you are interested, you can also access the paper on [PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6642361/).

From the home page, you have several options for getting started.

## Option 1:  Browse

In the first option, you can use the left navigation pane to **browse** by cancer type:

There are lots of tricks you can use within the search box.  For example, you can quickly find all Pan-Cancer TCGA studies by entering:  "tcga pancancer".  Or, you can quickly find all TCGA Studies, but remove the Pan-Cancer Studies by entering:  "tcga -pancancer".
{% endhint %}
