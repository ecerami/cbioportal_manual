## Introduction

All data within cBioPortal is organized within studies.  You can think of a study as a published study with an accompanying research paper, or a pre-published study that has not yet made it to publication.  In the public cBioPortal, we maintain over 200 published cancer studies, and new studies are added all the time.

The exact details for each study will vary, but most studies are linked to a publication within PubMed, and contain some form of genomic profiling data coupled with de-identified clinical data. For example, the (Cholangiocarcinoma study from MSKCC)[https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=chol_msk_2018] contains data on 192 patients. This includes mutation data and copy number data from a targeted gene panel, along with de-identified clinical data that was gathered from patient medical records.
